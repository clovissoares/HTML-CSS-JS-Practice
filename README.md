# HTML-CSS-JS-Practice

### Hello! My name is Cl√≥vis Soares.

I made this repository to practice after being inspired by [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com/) (You should check it out).

I'm going to remake his designs using just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS (Maybe not daily, but let's see), of which are all kindly under the [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
to try and learn front-end development.
